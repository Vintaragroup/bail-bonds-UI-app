# Session Progress Log â€” 2025-10-02

This log tracks todayâ€™s incremental work: actions taken, results, and any code/docs changes. Each section maps to the current task list.

## 1) Server sanity checks (lint/tests)

Actions
- Ran API spec validation: `npm -C server run -s lint:api`

Results
- âœ… OpenAPI is valid. (3.0.3)
- No dedicated server unit test script found in `server/package.json` (no `test`), so test step is N/A for server.

Notes/Improvements
- Consider adding minimal server tests (e.g., route-level validators or integration smoke via supertest) in a follow-up task.
- Server provides smoke/validator scripts (health, dashboard, windows v2); these can be wired into CI later.

Status
- Completed. Proceeding to Compose-based smoke to verify runtime health and UI wiring.

## 2) Compose smoke: API + Web

Plan
- Start Docker Compose (dev) with the hotreload profile to run API + Web + Mongo.
- Verify API health endpoints respond and basic web container serves the SPA.
- If stable, optionally run `server/scripts/smoke-health.mjs`.

Results
- Pending run.

---

Checklist and Acceptance Criteria
- Server: OpenAPI spec passes validation. [DONE]
- Runtime: API `/api/health` returns 200 and JSON. [TBD]
- Runtime: Web serves index at `http://localhost:5173`. [TBD]
- Optional: Dashboard smoke scripts return success. [TBD]

Follow-ups queued for later tasks
- Extend OpenAPI for CRM contact fields and enrichment endpoints.
- Add targeted API tests (PATCH `/cases/:id/crm`, enrichment run/select).
- UI validation polish for address/phone.

## 3) Enrichment provider refactor & Pipl wiring

Task list (incremental)
1. Create shared enrichment provider abstraction and registry (whitepages + placeholder for pipl).
2. Update backend routes/models/tests to use provider abstraction (`/cases/:id/enrichment/:providerId`, providers listing).
3. Implement Pipl provider wrapper (request normalization, response normalization, TTL/error handling).
4. Update frontend hooks/UI to support provider selection, input persistence per provider, and enriched results (emails, meta).
5. Refresh OpenAPI/env docs and ensure progress log reflects outcomes.

Status
- Task 1: âœ… Registry & provider utils scaffolded.
- Task 2: âœ… Backend routes/models/tests migrated to provider-aware endpoints.
- Task 3: âœ… Pipl provider module implemented with normalized responses (pending live key for verification).
- Task 4: ðŸš§ In progress â€“ UI now surfaces provider switch & enriched data; needs final verification once backend contracts settle.
- Task 5: ðŸš§ Partially updated (`.env.example`, server README, OpenAPI); requires final review after UI completes.

Next actions
- Finish frontend enrichment UI polish (meta display, loading states) and verify against mocked provider data.
- Run `npm run build` (frontend) and server smoke tests once API changes settle.
- After obtaining a Pipl API key, capture manual test results and update this log.

## 4) Frontend enrichment polish & validation

Actions
- Replaced provider-specific hooks with provider-aware versions and added per-provider input state, loading placeholders, and meta display (candidate emails, available record counts).
- Updated the `Enrichment` tab UI to let users switch providers safely while preserving cached inputs; refreshed attach-button logic to use provider metadata.
- Adjusted vitest mocks (`cases.crm_enrichment.test.js`) to assert provider labels/meta flow; tests now cover registry path.

Results
- âœ… UI renders provider dropdown, handles empty/loading states, and surfaces Pipl/Whitepages data consistently.
- âœ… Tests pass locally (`vitest` file run via `npx vitest tests/cases.crm_enrichment.test.js`).

Notes
- Final manual verification still blocked pending real Pipl API key.

Status
- Completed. Ready for integration testing once credentials arrive.

## 5) Documentation & verification prep

Plan
- Confirm OpenAPI/env/README updates capture new providers (done), then stage instructions for running smoke tests once keys are in place.
- After obtaining a Pipl key, log manual test results and update this section.

Status
- Pending API key + smoke verification.

## 6) Messaging & GPS planning

Actions
- Reviewed existing markdown docs (final readiness tracker, check-ins integration plan, authentication review).
- Audited current codebase for messaging/GPS support (message model, case endpoints, lack of queue infra) to align docs with reality.
- Authored `docs/messaging-sms-integration.md` with end-to-end task list for wiring the SMS messaging module.
- Created `docs/messaging-provider-brief.md` comparing Twilio and alternatives for decision-making.
- Updated `docs/checkins-integration-plan.md` and `docs/final-feature-readiness.md` to track GPS verification work and link the new messaging plan.
- Refined SMS plan to note existing case message flows and need to unify them with the new service, and cross-linked provider brief.

Results
- Task plans captured and linked; provider decision brief drafted; doc updates reflect existing message model/case endpoints and highlight missing queue infrastructure.

Status
- Completed; share with messaging/check-ins owners for scheduling.

## 7) Twilio messaging + GPS queue implementation

Actions
- Added Redis service to `docker-compose.dev.yml` and wired `REDIS_URL` defaults across API containers.
- Introduced BullMQ queue factory, messaging worker, and placeholder GPS worker; auto-bootstrap via `initQueues()`.
- Implemented Twilio messaging service + webhooks (`/api/messages`, `/api/messages/send`, `/api/messages/twilio/*`) with audit logging.
- Updated case messaging routes to reuse the service, manual GPS ping endpoint to enqueue queue jobs, and refreshed OpenAPI/ENV docs.
- Replaced messaging page mocks with React Query data + inline composer wired to new API.

Results
- Messaging flows enqueue Twilio jobs; Redis/Bull scaffolding ready for sandbox credentials.
- Frontend surfaces live message data; further work needed for thread view, templates, and automated GPS scheduling.

Status
- Completed for baseline wiring; follow-up tasks tracked in integration docs.
